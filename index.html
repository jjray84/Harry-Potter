            <p>Congratulations on your acceptance into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!  Before we get started, there are a few items of housekeeping 
                to go over! Firstly, we have a great new group of first years who are eagerly awaiting to be sorted into their respective houses, so please take some time 
                to be sorted by means of the Sorting Hat!  Secondly, please note that Defense Against the Dark Arts will not be an option for 
                class this year as we could find no good replacement for the previous 15 professors we have had over the last 15 years.  Lastly, please remember that the Forbidden Forest is
                strictly off limits so all students, and the east wings 4th floor corridor is as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                With all of that not out of the way, it is time to start the sorting!
